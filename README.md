The Gaming Room client, Creative Technology Solutions (CTS), wanted a web-based version of their Android game "Draw It or Lose It," supporting multiple teams and unique identifiers for games, teams, and players. I did well with detailing the system architecture, class relationships, and technical environment, which ensured clear communication and alignment among team members. This structured documentation helped identify potential challenges like network latency and data consistency, enabling proactive solutions. If I could revise one part, I would enhance the security measures section with more implementation details and best practices for clearer guidance.

Understanding CTS's need for a seamless, cross-platform gaming experience, I ensured the software design met their requirements for multi-team support and unique identifiers. Considering user needs is crucial for creating intuitive and enjoyable software. In future projects, I will continue using these strategies, incorporating iterative development and feedback loops, and leveraging container orchestration tools like Kubernetes to enhance scalability and reliability, ensuring optimal performance under varying conditions.
